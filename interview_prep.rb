##HASHES

#create a hash

#Create a Hash with initial entries:

h # => {:foo=>0, :bar=>1, :baz=>2}
h[:foo]  #=> 0
h[:too] = 4
h # => {:foo=>0, :bar=>1, :baz=>2, :too=>4} 

#Iterate over hashes
person = {name: 'bob', height: '6 ft', weight: '160 lbs', hair: 'brown'}

person.each do |key, value|
  puts "Bob's #{key} is #{value}"
end
# => => {:name=>"bob", :height=>"6 ft", :weight=>"160 lbs", :hair=>"brown"} 


#You can use a Hash to initialize an object:
class Dev
  attr_accessor :name, :language
  def initialize(hash)
    self.name = hash[:name]
    self.language = hash[:language]
  end
end
matz = Dev.new(name: 'Matz', language: 'Ruby')
matz # => #<Dev: @name="Matz", @language="Ruby">


#FOR VS. EACH IN RUBY

# imperative for
for i in [1,2,3] do
  puts i
end

2

# functional each
[1,2,3].each { |i| puts i }

#There is a scope difference. After the for loop runs, the iterator variable (i.e. i) still exists. That doesnâ€™t happen with each, because each introduces a new lexical scope.


# what is a RESTful API ??

#An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST.
#REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource.


#SCHEMA DATABASE
# What would the schema look like for database containing doctors and patients

# How would you query this schema to determine all of a doctors patients?

# design a database for students, teachers and courses. Also, write a query to print all the students in a teacher's class.
